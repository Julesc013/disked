# Journal, recovery and durability

## Recovery semantics

Classify each operation as atomic-metadata (only when proven), replayable, resumable, rollback-capable, forward-recovery-only, irreversible-after-step, backup-required or forensic-best-effort. These can combine with precise scope. A small journal does not retain the original contents of a multi-terabyte overlapping move. Once overwritten bytes are absent from all backups, metadata cannot reconstruct them.

## Required journal properties

The eventual on-disk journal needs magic, exact encoding version, target and plan identities, provider closure, sequence, record kind, bounded payload length, checksums and explicit commit/seal behavior. Its parser rejects truncated, reordered, mismatched or unsupported critical records. A durable authorization/intention record precedes a bounded external effect; a verified completion record follows required target flush and recapture. A crash between effect and completion produces uncertain state requiring observation, not blind replay.

This baseline intentionally does NOT freeze a new binary journal encoding before the storage/durability spike. `DE-DEC-004` blocks production writer implementation until exact byte layout, torn-write handling, checksum, sector assumptions, flush guarantees, recovery algorithm and fault model are reviewed. `catalog/journal-model.json` defines state transitions for design tests; it is not a runtime journal or evidence that a power-loss test passed.

## Placement and retention

Store the journal/recovery capsule on a different physical resource or an explicitly owned area proven outside affected extents and failure domains. Alignment gaps are not free space. Record storage independence limitations: another partition on the same failing disk is not an independent backup. Keep the exact recovery-compatible provider closure reachable without network dependence. Redact secrets while preserving references needed by the operator.

## Recovery capsule

Include reviewed plan, original map/boot metadata, target identity, expected states, journal bootstrap, tool hashes, verifier contract, required backup references and human procedure. Verify the capsule before admitting a high-risk step. Recovery reidentifies the disk after reboot and refuses ambiguous matches. Signed or hashed capsules do not make their operation correct; they bind what was reviewed.

## Cancellation and flush

There is no universal cancellation point or atomic GPT switch. Mark safe checkpoints by operation, and distinguish user cancellation request from confirmed quiescence. Flush is a provider capability whose guarantees depend on stack and hardware. Successful API return may not prove power-loss persistence; qualification must describe cache/controller assumptions and physical tests where claimed.

## Lifetime and generation retention

Timeout, client loss or cancellation request does not seal an unobserved effect. Preserve the affected target's quarantine and exact journal/provider/executor identities until quiescence and postconditions are established. A replacement worker cannot blindly replay. Software maintenance must retain required generations, including when the operation is unreachable, until reconciliation permits retirement.

The recovery closure includes independent code access, state, reconstruction data, credential references and physical dependencies. Configuration caches and another partition on a failing disk do not meet an independent-backup requirement. DE-DEC-004 remains unresolved: state-model checks do not prove durable runtime encoding or power-loss safety.

## Normative requirements

### DE-REQ-043-01

Every admitted mutation MUST declare its recovery class and MUST NOT claim rollback without retained reconstruction data.

**Verification:** Review overlapping-move fixture and require backup/recovery classification.

### DE-REQ-043-02

Journal encoding and durability assumptions MUST be accepted before any production journal writer is admitted.

**Verification:** Decision gate DE-DEC-004 blocks physical-write work.

### DE-REQ-043-03

Recovery MUST reidentify the target and inspect uncertain effects instead of blindly replaying unsealed steps.

**Verification:** Crash-at-every-transition model and target-swap tests.
