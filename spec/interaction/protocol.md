# Machine protocol and transport

## Bootstrap transport

The initial machine transport is UTF-8 JSON for bounded request/response and NDJSON for event streams. Each line is one complete JSON value with a declared envelope schema. Reject duplicate JSON keys, invalid UTF-8, unbounded nesting, overlarge frames and nonfinite numbers. A single response is capped by profile; page large inventories. Use decimal strings for u64/large byte values and validate range semantically, not just with a digit regex.

Requests identify schema version, request ID, command ID and typed parameters. Mutating requests add plan digest, expected revision and idempotency key. Results distinguish refused, completed, accepted-running, failed, unknown and recovery-required. Error fields carry stable code, message key, parameters, platform error and safe remediation. Unknown critical request features are refused. Additive observational response fields may be retained by older readers.

## Operation identity

A request ID correlates one exchange. An operation ID outlives connections. Attempt IDs identify retry/dispatch attempts. Idempotency is bound to a canonical semantic request digest and scope; a reused key with different content is a conflict. A broken connection after dispatch does not prove cancellation, failure or success. Reconnect by operation ID and inspect retained state. Cancellation is a request with a receipt and a safe checkpoint; it is never immediate proof of no effect.

## Framing and ordering

Events carry sequence number, operation ID, type and typed payload. Sequence gaps are detectable; clients can resume from the retained sequence or request a fresh snapshot. Wall-clock time is informative, not the event ordering authority. Enforce quotas and back-pressure. Slow observers must not delay journal durability or raw storage operations indefinitely.

## Security

Stdio is suitable for a spawned unprivileged provider or client. It is not authentication by itself. Elevated IPC requires target-specific peer authentication, restrictive access, fresh session binding and bounded messages. Never accept arbitrary shell text as an execution plan. Bulk images and block data use separately authorized bounded handles or streams. Do not expose a network listener in the first product; future remote control needs a separate threat model.

## Normative requirements

### DE-REQ-022-01

Machine messages MUST be bounded, versioned and reject duplicate keys or unknown required features.

**Verification:** Protocol malformed-message suite plus maximum-size cases.

### DE-REQ-022-02

Retry and cancellation MUST preserve operation/attempt identities and distinguish an unknown outcome from a completed one.

**Verification:** Disconnect after dispatch, reconnect and assert no duplicate effect or fabricated cancellation.
